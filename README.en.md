# Welcome to the "programming-lab-exercises" Repository!

## About the Repository

Hello! This is the **"programming-lab-exercises"** repository, where I have compiled my solutions for various C language exercises from my Programming Laboratory classes in the Computer Science course at IFCE (Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology of Ceará), under the guidance of Professor **Daniel Silva Ferreira.**

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to document my progress and learning journey during the C programming laboratory classes at IFCE.

Additionally, the professor required the submission of the lists as links from a GitHub repository.

## Folder Structure

In this repository, I have organized the exercises into folders, each dedicated to a specific list of C programming laboratory exercises.

Within each folder, you will find a document listing the problems for that session (00_Questions.txt), followed by separate documents providing the answers for each individual problem. Inside these folders, there are also pre-compiled binaries with gcc.exe (Rev7, Built by MSYS2 project) 13.1.0.

Additionally, there is a folder containing codes used in the classes that are not part of the assignments, each named and dated (DD/MM/YY).

The structure is designed to facilitate navigation through the exercises, allowing efficient location of problems and their solutions. Feel free to explore the folders and documents to access the exercises and their respective solutions.

## How to Use

Explore the repository freely and dive into the C language exercises that interest you the most. You can review the solutions, compare them with your own answers, and learn from different approaches to problem-solving in C. If you have suggestions, improvements, or feedback, I would be more than happy to hear them.

## Contribution

While this repository mainly contains my own work, I am open to contributions from others. If you find errors, have additional C language exercises to share, or want to suggest improvements, please submit your contributions through pull requests.
