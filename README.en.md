# Welcome to the "programming-lab-exercises" Repository!

_Read this in other languages: [English](README.en.md), [Português](README.md)._

Hello there! This is the repository **"programming-lab-exercises"**, where I have gathered my answers to various C language exercises from my Computer Science **"Programming Lab"** classes at IFCE (Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia do Ceará), under the guidance of my teacher, **Daniel Silva Ferreira.**

## About the Repository

In this repository, you will find a collection of folders, each containing C language exercises and their respective solutions from different programming lab sessions. The exercises cover various topics and concepts in C programming, offering a comprehensive learning experience in computer science.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to document my progress and learning journey during the C language programming lab classes at IFCE. By keeping track of the exercises and their solutions, I aim to build a valuable resource for myself and others who might be interested in exploring C programming concepts.

## Folder Structure

In this repository, I've organized the exercises into folders, each dedicated to a specific C language programming lab exercise list.

Within each folder, you'll find a document listing the problems for that session followed by separate documents that provide the answers for each individual problem. Additionally, there is a folder containing codes used in the classes that are not part of assignments, each named and dated (DD/MM/YY).

The structure is designed to make it easy for you to navigate through the exercises and locate the problems and their corresponding solutions efficiently. This organization ensures a clear separation between the problem statements and the solutions, enhancing the learning experience and promoting better code management.

Feel free to explore the folders and documents to access the exercises and their respective solutions. 

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the repository and delve into the C language exercises that interest you the most. You can review the solutions, compare your own answers, and learn from different approaches to problem-solving in C. If you have any suggestions, improvements, or feedback, I am more than happy to hear from you.

## Contribution

While this repository primarily contains my own work, I am open to contributions from others. If you find any errors, have additional C language exercises to share, or wish to suggest improvements, please submit your contributions via pull requests.
