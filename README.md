# Welcome to the "programming-lab-exercises" Repository!

*_Read this in other languages: [Portuguese ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·]()


Hello there! This is the official repository of **"programming-lab-exercises,"** where I have gathered my answers to various C language exercises from my Computer Science **"Programming Lab"** classes at IFCE (Instituto Federal de EducaÃ§Ã£o, CiÃªncia e Tecnologia do CearÃ¡), under the guidance of my teacher, **Daniel Silva Ferreira.**

## About the Repository

In this repository, you will find a collection of folders, each containing C language exercises and their respective solutions from different programming lab sessions. The exercises cover various topics and concepts in C programming, offering a comprehensive learning experience in computer science.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to document my progress and learning journey during the C language programming lab classes at IFCE. By keeping track of the exercises and their solutions, I aim to build a valuable resource for myself and others who might be interested in exploring C programming concepts.

## Folder Structure

In this repository, I've organized the exercises into folders, each dedicated to a specific C language programming lab exercise list. Within each folder, you'll find a document listing the problems for that session. Additionally, there are separate documents that provide the answers for each individual problem.

The structure is designed to make it easy for you to navigate through the exercises and locate the problems and their corresponding solutions efficiently. This organization ensures a clear separation between the problem statements and the solutions, enhancing the learning experience and promoting better code management.

Feel free to explore the folders and documents to access the exercises and their respective solutions. 

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the repository and delve into the C language exercises that interest you the most. You can review the solutions, compare your own answers, and learn from different approaches to problem-solving in C. If you have any suggestions, improvements, or feedback, I am more than happy to hear from you. Together, we can enhance this repository and make it an even better resource for all C language learners.

## Contribution

While this repository primarily contains my own work, I am open to contributions from others. If you find any errors, have additional C language exercises to share, or wish to suggest improvements, please submit your contributions via pull requests. Let's collaborate and create a thriving community of C language learners!

## Connect with Me

I'm excited to connect with fellow learners and developers interested in C programming. Feel free to contact me through GitHub or other social platforms.
